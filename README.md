# Background

I want help creating a open source project on tracking down and documenting open source Cyberware projects worldwide of significance.

Cyberware is technology that attempts to create a working interface between machines/computers and the human nervous system, including the brain. Examples include Prosthetics e.g. prosthetic arms, brain-computer interfaces e.g. EEG headsets, medical instruments such as ECG heart rate readers etc.,

Our ultimate wish is that a organisation or person with more qualified seniority take ownership and steer guidance on this project.

The idea is for the safety and benefit of the entire human race to collaborate knowledge that often  performed in secret by unqualified, unregulated biohackers.

We want this to be a database that the public can find out the research that is being done on cyberware so that they may collaborate, and document safely together.

The author Sumeet Singh doesnâ€™t encourage any unsafe, unregulated, unqualified research projects. Always refer to your local governments laws on each research project.

You are able to freely contribute to this codebase as you wish as long as you acknowledge the changes you make aren't affiliated with is of your own opinion.

You can contact the author for support anytime.




# Project

The software code base was originally written using the Python programming language.

the origin of software code base is hosted here https://github.com/SumeetSinghJi/Cyberware-part-picker

This originally to be a publically website acessible application that will display an graphical interface of an humanoid that you can design to look like yourself, including any disabilities such as being wheelchair bound, gender, skin colour, etc., 

You are then able to choose different parts of the bodies such as limbs by clicking on them and a list of safe curated non advertised devices are discussed, such
as by clicking on an hand shows options for microchips that could theoretically be implanted. Users can also contribute to the project and add journal articles to the cyberware part picker software to create new enteries for cyberware.

This can be modified commerically for business to advertise their own legal safe regulated goods as an portfolio advertisment of goods. Any suggesstions to add or remove products are user discretion provided they are of your own opinion and not related to the author.
