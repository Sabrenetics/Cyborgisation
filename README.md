# Background

I want help creating a open source project on tracking down and documenting open source Cyberware projects worldwide of significance.

Cyberware is technology that attempts to create a working interface between machines/computers and the human nervous system, including the brain. Examples include Prosthetics e.g. prosthetic arms, brain-computer interfaces e.g. EEG headsets, medical instruments such as ECG heart rate readers etc.,

Our ultimate wish is that a organisation or person with more qualified seniority take ownership and steer guidance on this project.

The idea is for the safety and benefit of the entire human race to collaborate knowledge that often  performed in secret by unqualified, unregulated biohackers.

We want this to be a database that the public can find out the research that is being done on cyberware so that they may collaborate, and document safely together.

The author Sumeet Singh doesnâ€™t encourage any unsafe, unregulated, unqualified research projects. Always refer to your local governments laws on each research project.

You are able to freely contribute to this codebase as you wish as long as you acknowledge the changes you make aren't affiliated with is of your own opinion.

You can contact the author for support anytime.




# Project

The software is written using the Python programming language (https://www.python.org/)

the software is hosted on www.github.com

This web acessible application will display an graphical interface of an humanoid that you can design to look like yourself, including any disabilities such as being wheelchair bound, gender, skin colour, etc., 

You are then able to choose different parts of the bodies such as limbs by clicking on them and a list of available cyberware wearable technology products are available.

A toggle can appear for both sources with a disclaimer for each. The idea is to showcase the available cyberware you can wear as wearable technology that are legal in a safe and controlled format. Any suggesstions to add or remove products are user discretion provided they are of your own opinion and not related to the author.

The source of products come from Open source community cyberware projects e.g. clicking on legs leads to Pegleg (https://hackaday.com/2019/08/29/pegleg-raspberry-pi-implanted-below-the-skin-not-coming-to-a-store-near-you/), clicking on chest or head leads to OpenBCI ECG/EEG kit. However you can even use this for your own private or commercial works considering legality.
